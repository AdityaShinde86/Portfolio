# Welcome to my portfolio repository!
My personal portfolio website is aimed at presenting my skills, projects, and career profile in an organized and professional manner.
It was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is important to note, however, that this excels in front-end development, particularly in ease of navigation and speed.
It is also responsive, which means that people using desktops, tablets, or even smartphones can optimally view the site.
The site contains an “About Me” page, an dynamic projects gallery containing links to live demos as well as their corresponding GitHub repositories, an overview of my technical skills, my resume in PDF format, and a contact form.
I can be easily reached and contacted through the site, lets me provide proactive information to potential employers or clients.
Navigation and UI were focused on as well, making sure the site’s animations do not influence loading times.
Emphasis was put on creating a clean and organized structure, as well as intuitive navigation and fast loading times.
To maintain a clean look, animations and transitions were strongly limited, also lightening the stuffed loading times.
Using EmailJS, or a backend service like Flask or Node.js can make submissions instantly contactable.
Every project comes with a short summary alongside the tech stack, source code, and live preview links.
SEO best practices focus on uncluttered site structures with a clear purpose to boost discoverability.
Willing to work together and receive critiques. You may copy the project, propose revisions, or contact me through the provided contact details.
